CollabCloud is an online platform inspired by GitHub but created to be more inclusive and user-friendly for everyone, particularly students, beginners, and hobbyists. While GitHub primarily targets software development and version control, CollabCloud supports all kinds of projects—whether they’re code, documents, designs, or even notes—allowing users to easily share, collaborate on, and store their work in one place. The goal is to simplify project sharing and foster a collaborative environment that’s open to all.
